## ERT connect
ERT-connect is one of the newest experience based planner [1]. ERT connet implementation exists as a PR to a OMPL [https://github.com/ompl/ompl/pull/783](https://github.com/ompl/ompl/pull/783). However the PR seems inactive. 

So, This repository pickup the PR and port to a standalone repository and provide minimalistic example.

In the original code in PR, the procedure to pickup a single trajectory from the library is not implemented. However, from the equation (4) of the RA-L paper, I found that it is the same as Lightning's. Thus, I implemented the relevant trajectory selection by using LightningDB already exists in ompl.


## Install
Assume you are running on ubuntu 20.04 or higher (will fail to build in older ubuntu due to boost version mismatch)

install and build
```bash
sudo apt install libompl-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-serialization-dev -y
git clone https://github.com/HiroIshida/ertconnect
cd ertconnect
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j4
```

## example
./build/minimalistic_example
```
